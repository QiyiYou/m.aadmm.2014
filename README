3. Reference on BOSVS

The PPI example compares AADMM with an existing L-ADMM algorithm with backtracking, 
namely, BOSVS, that was published in

Chen, Yunmei, William W. Hager, Maryam Yashtini, Xiaojing Ye, and Hongchao Zhang, 
Bregman operator splitting with variable stepsize for total variation image reconstruction. 
Computational Optimization and Applications 54, no. 2 (2013): 317-342.
